## Datacamp notes
This repo documents all the notes I've taken going through datacamp courses. I'll also jot down some random project ideas.

### Completed courses:
* Parallel computing with Dask
* Supervised Learning with Scikit-learn
* Unsupervised Learning in Python
* Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets
* Introduction to PySpark
* Deep Larning in Python

### Scikit-learn supervised learning (Classification, Regression) basic workflow
* Preprocessing data: fill/drop/impute missing data
* Standarlized, normalized, scaled features
* Train_test_split the dataset (test_size, random_state)
* Cross-validation (CV)
* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch CV, randomized CV)
* model.fit(X_train,y_train)
* model.predict(X_test)
* Evaluate performance (R2, F1, and score etc.)
* Put everything together using Pipeline.
